# Citation Guide

Note: links to documents are provided wherever possible. Linking is good!

Please only cite things that you actually use in your essay (i.e. things that will be footnoted). You don't need to include a website simply because you glanced at it while you were researching your site.

However, citations are _really_ important. They're the best way to show someone how you did your research; if your bibliography looks weak, then your research looks weak.

## In-text Citations
- For citations, just use the author's last name and page number, separated by a comma: (Gibbs, 13)
- Include page numbers (government documents sometimes have funky numbering, but more info is better than less)
- Cluster your footnote tags at the very bottom of the document (this makes your citations easier to edit after the fact)

## Bibliographies
- Alphabetize your bibliographies by author's last name
- Be consistent (Chicago style is the default for historical writing, so it's a good place to start if you're feeling lost)
- Be sensitive of links and permissions (someone reading your article may not be able to access the UNM Libraries server, so best not to include links to gated resources)
