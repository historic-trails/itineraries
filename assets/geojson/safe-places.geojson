Another story attributes the meaning to a scout whose horse pitched him into the river. As he climbed out, he said \"Ugh, Neosho\" ('Neosho' here meaning 'water pocket' or 'pothole'). Yet another possibility comes from the Osage move westward after the Treaty of 1825. As they searched for an attractive river site, scouts let their horses drink. The chief, having been told the water was clear, was disappointed upon seeing water muddied by the horses ('Neosho' in this case means 'water made muddy'). The river's name has also been translated to mean 'bright water' or 'clear, cold water' (it was originally called the White River). Rydjord (1968), 127-128.",
