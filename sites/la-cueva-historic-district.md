# La Cueva Historic District


In the latter half of the nineteenth century, La Cueva shaped the region around it by aiding travelers along the Santa Fe Trail. The site consists of several structures: the Romero Hacienda, a [grist mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gristmill), a mercantile building, the Church of San Rafael, stables, a farm, some [*acequîas*](http://www.nmacequiacommission.state.nm.us/Publications/kfrancis_harvard_proposal04.pdf), and a few outbuildings.

Located in the middle of the [Mora Land Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_grants_in_New_Mexico), La Cueva was founded by Vicente Romero around 1851. Although he was not one of the original grantees, Romero managed to purchase shares totaling 33,000 acres from original grantees or their descendants.[^NPS-Form] The name 'La Cueva' (or, 'The Cave') has many possible origins.  Romero had been a sheepherder, and legend has it that he utilized caves in the area to seek shelter when needed.  This may have earned him the title of 'La Cueva.'[^NPS-Form-2]  Others say the ranch was named La Cueva simply due to a nearby cave.[^ranchos1] While the name's origin may never be known, one thing is certain: Romero realized the potential of the land, the power of the nearby [Mora River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mora_River), and the need for grain on the Santa Fe Trail.

## Milling, Farming, and the Santa Fe Trail

La Cueva's potential for hydropower helped turn the area into an important stop along the Santa Fe Trail. Vicente Romero would divert a portion of the Mora River into a network of _acequîas_ (irrigation ditches) that powered an on-site grist mill (the La Cueva Mill).[^NPS-lchd-3] In addition to powering the mill wheel, the acequîas also provided irrigation to Romero's farm.[^Water-1]  Regional mills were crucial for travelers in the nineteenth century, providing processed grain that diversified the fairly simple fare prepared by most wagon trains.[^NPS-SFT-1]  La Cueva's grist mill also provided milled flour and wheat to [Fort Union](https://www.nps.gov/foun/index.htm) in nearby Watrous.  The Southwest's largest fort in the late nineteenth century, Fort Union was integral to the Union Army during the Civil War.[^NPS-SFT-2] As many as sixty horse and oxen delivered milled grain to the fort each day.[^Ranchos-1]

## A Place to Meet, Trade, & Rest

The Romero hacienda served as a community center for the region.[^NPS-LCHD-5]  While few records exist, we do know that ranchers and travelers in the region would stop at the house to meet. The hacienda was attached to a mercantile store and a large stable where travelers could buy supplies and water their horses.[^NPS-LCHD-6] The network of mercantile stores like Romero's helped the Santa Fe Trail become a major avenue for the [United States' occupation of the American Southwest](https://www.politico.com/story/2007/08/us-annexes-new-mexico-on-aug-22-1846-005459); the trail also became a military supply route during the [Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_civil_war), with the mercantile stores flanking the trail providing supplies to marching armies.[^NPS-SFT-3] The exact mercantile that the Romero's sold are unknown, but items commonly traded in Santa Fe indicate what could have been sold here: dry goods, hardware, clothing, guns, books, liquor, groceries, and more.[^NPS-SFT-4]

## A Mission Arrives

Romero also commissioned a church on his property, which would become known as the [San Rafael Mission Church](https://www.cstones.org/current-projects/2018/3/8/san-rafael-church-la-cueva-new-mexico).[^NPS-LCHD-7]  Construction on the church began in 1862 and finished in 1870.  This mission was used as a family chapel for the Romeros, and subsequent property owners used it as a family chapel, as well. Priests from near Lamy came to help build the mission.  By the 1840s missionaries were a common presence along the Santa Fe Trail; this was a notable departure from the merchants, wagon masters, muleteers and ox drovers that preceded them.[^NPS-SFT-5]

## La Cueva Today
The La Cueva Historic District is located at the intersection of NM442 and NM518, 33.1 miles northwest of Ft. Union National Monument. Today La Cueva is a private residence as well as a [farm](https://www.lacuevafarm.com/).  In the summer months travelers can pick raspberries and bring them home.  But the site's current form still holds clues to the history of La Cueva. Mora County is home to many historic landmarks on the historic register, which could be a way for the economically depressed area to benefit from its rich past.
