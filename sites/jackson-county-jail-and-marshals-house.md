One would have to consider one's self wealthy in American culture and history while traveling along the remains of the historic Santa Fe Trail.  One would  find a wide variety of sites consisting of landmarks, river crossings, other natural features and structures, and man-made structures that have all been designated as historic by the National Park Service.  Among these historical sites, located in Independence, Missouri, stands the second incarnation of the Jackson County Jail and Marshal's House.  Not just an interesting architectural structure, the Jail and Marshal’s House was an outpost of law and order on the Santa Fe Trail.  Depending on a person’s starting point and direction of travel along the Santa Fe Trail, the jail would have either been located toward the beginning of a person’s journey and therefore one of the last reminders of societal laws and constraints as they ventured into the lands of westward expansion.  Or, it would have marked a person’s reintegration into society from the more free, individualistic, and, what many at the time considered, a rougher type of lifestyle, that they may have experienced along the less settled portions of the trail.  Thus, just the sight itself or mere mention of the structure could have invoked several differing feelings, attitudes and visions of what the jail may have meant to those traveling on the Santa Fe Trail.

Located on almost the most Eastern point of the Santa Fe Trail is the town of Independence, Missouri which grew exponentially during the height of the trail's use. It became a large outfitting post and operation center for caravans of individual travelers and entire families heading West. In fact, “Independence was established in 1827 to succeed old Franklin and Arrow Rock farther downriver as the main depot of the Santa Fe trade” and was considered “ ‘very different,’ with a scattering of ‘low and mean’ houses composed of logs and clay” (Mattes, 1985).  Originally, built as a log structure in 1827, this building burned to the ground and was replaced with a more modern brick structure in 1859 and it is this version of the building which stands today.  Then, as now, a person standing at 217 North Main in the city of Independence, Missouri would find themselves not just looking at the second incarnation of the Jackson County Jail, but at the acting spearhead on the American side of the Santa Fe Trail (Mattes, 1987). To give context to how much open space each territory's law enforcement agency had to cover when the jail was constructed in 1859, there were only 33 states, with Oregon being the 33rd and only added that year.

## Purpose

The Jackson County Jail and Marshal's House was a building of many purposes during the height of western expansion in American history.  Along with being a home to the jailer and his family and a fully functioning jail, it also served as the home office of the County Sheriff and Marshal.  This jail was central to all law enforcement officials in the Missouri area and due to to the slow rate of communication and the ability of law enforcement officials to respond to incidents or request for help in a timely manner, one can imagine that the closer one lived to the city of Independence the more likely a person could seek, expect, and receive justice.  This could have of meant that one's geographical position to the jail could have also played a part in a person’s sense of safety in that the farther one lived from the building the more danger they were in because the ability the law had to influence a person’s behavior may have been vastly depleted the farther out one lived.  The jail was originally built to house people who broke laws, some of which sound familiar to those we follow today, such as horse racing on public streets, firing guns in town, operating a gaming house, disturbing the peace, disturbing a religious meeting, and assault and battery.  Others, we might find humorous today like building a toilet without the proper pit beneath it (Gilbert, 1985).  However, during the Civil War, the jail served a different function, one which revealed the allegiance of the town of Independence.  [The jail served as housing for Confederate prisoners of war as well as individuals who refused to sign the Union’s Oath of Loyalty or follow the Union Army’s issue of General Order No. 11 in which residents were forced from their homes and towns as these areas were being labeled battle zones and those who failed to comply and leave, be they men, women or children, were all thrown in and locked together inside of the jail.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Order_No._11_(1863))  The law enforcement official enforcing these laws was known as a marshal and it was usually a position held by a person of some wealth and power.  The marshal acted as an overall politician or spokesperson for the jail when it came to political or social matters and was assigned to oversee the bigger picture aspects of the jail.  During the Civil War, the marshal changed to more of a military officer called a provost marhsal. On the other hand, a person commonly referred to as a jailer was paid $50 a month along with free room and board for himself and his family to live in the same structure of the jail (Gilbert, 1985).  The jailer and his family were responsible for the maintenance of the jail as well as for the security of the prisoners and for the jail itself, as it was common place or expected that the jailer’s wife would cook food and feed the prisoners along with her own family.  In certain extreme situations, upon the sudden death of her husband then the wife could herself take over the job and the expectations that were once laid upon her husband.  [For example, a jailer’s wife named Mary, found herself taking over her husband’s job and responsibilities after he was murdered in a failed prison escape.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFs_yAetp08)  Mary was the first woman in charge of a jail in America.

## Architecture and Floorplan

The architectural style of the Jackson County Jail and Marshal’s House is interesting in that it illustrates the evolution of prison housing.  The original log structure proved inadequate at housing prisoners.  Once after becoming so infested with ticks and other similar parasites, the log structure had to be cleared out while officials could run a herd of sheep through the jail in an attempt to remove the bugs (Gilbert, 1985).  The log building could not keep the bugs out nor did it provide adequate shelter or protection for the inmates from the elements as evident by the large number of inmate deaths reported from exposure.  Thus, when the jail was rebuilt in 1859, it was built with brick, an improvement and upgrade over the previous material.  The new structure was also built with a very interesting feature in that the marshal's parlor, the jailer, and the jailer's family would share one connected building with the jail.  There were two different doors placed at the front of the two story building on opposite sides with one being used for official jail business and the other being used by the family which perhaps gave those living there a sense that they did not live in a jail or reside with those who broke the law.  Even though the family lived to one side of the building with the jail on the other side, there was still some overlap between the two.  With the multiple front doors attempting to give the illusion of completely separate areas, the family area at the front of the building and the jail located at the rear, there was only one kitchen designed to support both.  The cells are located at the back of the jail with six rooms on the bottom floor and another six rooms mirrored on the top floor.  Each cell was given a small iron grated window that allowed for airflow from the outside in to the cells.  The cells were secured with two iron doors and the inner door was grated with the outer to make one solid piece.  Each cell was made up of two foot thick limestone blocks which gave no protection from the cold and the only heat and light source was a single candle placed out of the cells in the center of the hallway.  Each cell was designed to hold three so if only half of the cells were full then the residents living in the building could have been the jailer, his wife and their children living with 18 criminals.  During the Civil War though regulations or expectations of prisoner management must have changed as there could be as many as 20 Confederate prisoners of war crammed into each cell which would have meant hundreds of prisoners living with and being looked after by the jailer and his family.

## The Most Famous and Other Well-Known Prisoners

Throughout the jail’s century of use there were thousands of prisoners housed with most being of little concern in the eyes of our society’s history but some, however, were of historical note.  [Among these, there is one that most even in our time would be able to recognize, recognize his name if not through his own actions in history then through the actions of a close family member—Frank James.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_James)  James was the jail’s most famous inmate in his time and in the jail’s entire history.  Frank was the older brother and fellow accomplice of the famous bank and railroad robbing Jesse James.  It is easy to come to this conclusion as Frank’s cell remains in the jail today intact and preserved in the same condition as it was in when he was living there.  Frank’s stay at the jail was not a common one and was most likely a result of his celebrity status among the people of the day.  Frank was given free run of the entire jail along with a fully furnished cell of imported rugs from Brussels, fine furniture, paintings, beddings and was also allowed to have visitors and host card games in his cell at night (Jackson and Kirkman, 2012).  [Another well-known prisoner in his day was Confederate guerilla leader William Clarke Quantrill who was briefly incarcerated at the Jackson County Jail.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Quantrill)  [Quantrill was the leader of the Quantrill Raiders, a Confederate guerilla group, who attacked the town of Lawrence, Kansas in what is known as the Lawrence Massacre.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_massacre)

Throughout the jail’s history it has remained useful to the community in its immediate area and beyond. While today Independence is "for all visible purposes. . . a suburb of Kansas City," one of "The only tangible links with the past" is the “restored Jackson County Jail and Marshal’s House, of 1859 vintage' (Mattes, 1985).  Although as time progresses, the distance and power of influence the jail once had seems long gone and forgotten.  The original jail was built in 1827 and was maintained until it burned down.  Its brick replacement, erected in 1859, served in its original capacity of a jail until the year of its decommission in 1933 (“Santa Fe Trail Association”).  Even after the jail was rebuilt a second time it was continuously renovated to serve the needs of the surrounding communities, like in 1907 when another smaller brick structure was added to the rear of the building in order to add more cells for the housing and confinement of chain gangs who worked on the roads, sewers and other similarly natured projects for the surrounding town and city (Jackson and Kirkman, 2012).  A few years after its decommission as a jail, the building was turned into a museum with some areas inside the structure becoming frozen in time, as was the cell Frank James was said to have stayed in.  This shows a sense of pride in the jail itself as well as the jail’s history and relationship to the more famously known people of past time periods.  The jail has not only a legacy that is left for those who lived or experienced it on a personal level but a legacy that continues to grow and influence minds and thoughts of people as it survives today.  [When former President Harry Truman himself in the year 1959 personally halted and ceased the destruction of the jail (as he was a former resident, lawyer, and judge in the town of Independence, Missouri), he preserved the building’s life.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman)  Now, as a building on the National Register of Historic Places since 1970, its legacy will continue into the future as a protected piece of the Santa Fe Trail and American history (“Jackson County Jail and Marshal’s House”, Wikipedia).
